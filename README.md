# Doodl
A simple MacOS App written in Swift, to draw temporary doodles on your screen.  Inspired by the doodles you can draw while screen sharing in a Slack call.

## Color / line width
The app is just a transparent web view drawn over the screen, so there's nothing stopping you from editing the `main.html` file in the app bundle, and setting it to whatever you want.

## Todo
- [x] Make into a menubar app
- [ ] Global hotkey to pull focus
- [ ] Fade out drawing
- [ ] Preference pane to adjust color / width
